## Abstract
Time-series techniques are valuable tools to solve many real-world problems, with classification being a crucial one. In the literature, there are well-established solutions for the supervised setting. However, few entries deal with classification in an unsupervised manner. Similarly, the field of unsupervised classification of time series using deep learning methods remains mostly unexplored. In this work, we propose a method to build a deep learning model for unsupervised time series classification and compare its performance with existing approaches from the supervised and unsupervised literature.
